We need to start naming things consistently between the four of us. I created this style guide and refactored a lot of the code to match this. We'll need to add more to this and decide things as a team, but I figured this is a good place to start at least and we can change things later as we need to.


Color variable names
	camel case, full words, begin with "color"
	ex: colorPrimary, colorDefaultBackground, colorButtonEnabled, colorButtonDisabled


Java classes
	begin with capital, camel case, full words
	Module main page is Parent Activity
	ex:   MoodCreateEntry, DietParentActivity


Variables
	camel case, full words, descriptive
	ex: startDateTextView, sleepQualityNumberTextView

Resources
	Keep a unique phrase up front for the resources in your module or activity. Try and keep resources in their own logical 		xml files as well if possible.
	ex: ex_rb_a (in the exercise module, all resources start with ex; ex_rb_a is a radio button inside the exercise module.)
