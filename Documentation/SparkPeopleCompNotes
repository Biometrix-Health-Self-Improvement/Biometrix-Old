Messaging:
SparkPeople is more about losing weight in a supportive community using calorie in calorie out tools.
BioMetriX is more about reporting general biometrics and analysing them against specific functions, for example, does eating more refined sugars late in the day make my depression harder to manage?

Theme:
As you can see, both employ the default android material designs for the most part.
SparkPeople has a blue and white clinical theme, where as the default color scheme of BioMetriX is pink and teal.

Features: 
These are the general features of SparkPeople. Here you can see the full nutritional breakdown of what you have eaten today,
here is a differential report that lets you know how much you have to exercise to burn off the chocolate. 
And on the right there is exercise entry, and you can type in two letters and it will automatically populate this list
and give you calories burned for your body type. BOOM! You can't do this any better.

SparkPeople also links frequently to a parent website full of weight loss articles.
Here are some social functions. Theres a forum, blogs, accountability buddies, groups, and QAs with pros. Alot of it may seem counter-productive, IE a thread about a 3000 calorie
McDonalds cheat day where everyone pats each other on the back for DIET cokes. BUT, communities keep people using SparkPeople - more on that later

So what features does BioMetriX have that SparkPeople doesn't?
Hopefully BioMetriX will eventually allow for customizable modules for 
seeing how you biometrics (eatan sleepan ex-sizing) affect it.
E.G. When I don't sleep more than 6 hours my schizophrenia is more pronounced and more frequent.
Or my daily productivity is best when I have had exactly 8 hours of sleep and 90mg of caffeine, 
nothing else affects it as much as those two values.

This is as oppossed to SparkPeoples major emphasis on weight loss. In a few words, BioMetriX is an 'all in one' solution whilst SparkPeople is more for weight loss

Other than the cusomizable modules build for more general health and mental health,
BioMetriX has no more major features OR any better features than SparkPeople.

Retention:
SparkPeople retains users with its excellent social functions,
showing users their progress over time (consistent 2 pound losses each week)
It also has reminders to enter data, and notifications of encouragement.

My dream for BioMetriX' user retention is to have digital pets inside the app. You nurture each other and grow with each other
They are always happy to see you, they guide you through using the app, and reward using the app frequently.

I also want to have a microtransaction economy where you earn currency by reporting data into the app consistently and
when you make actually progress. You could spend this currency on dressing up your pets, playing mini-games, etc.
Think of the exploitive powers of something like candy crush being used for good, being used to get JR. to stop eating so much damn candy.


Currency has to be done carefully, SparkPeople tried it a ways back. If you earn 100 spark points by reading their articles and clicking ads,
you would be entered in a chance to win a 100$ gift card, people just made bots and invalidated their data. So they cut out spark points entirely 
since it was a failure.
